# go-ui
UI for go game

See it at https://vios-ai.github.io/go-ui/

Fully functional Go game engine and simple minimal UI. Using html5 canvas / es6.
Let's you play and (auto)save your games on local browser storage with no server involved. Works on phones too.
Also let's you export and import games in standard SGF format. It now fully reads the main variation of any SGF (file a bug if you find otherwise) including handicap games. For instance https://vios-ai.github.io/go-ui/?url=https://online-go.com/api/v1/games/11199236/sgf
